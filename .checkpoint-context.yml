context:
    problem_statement: Implementing two-tier context system to maintain LLM development continuity
    key_insights:
        - insight: Context discontinuity is the primary challenge in LLM-assisted development
          impact: Capturing 'why' decisions were made enables effective session resumption and consistent decision-making
          scope: project
        - insight: Two-tier context (point-in-time + project-wide) manages LLM context window size
          impact: Project file stays small and focused while checkpoint context preserves full history
          scope: project
        - insight: Human curation is essential for project-level context quality
          impact: Automated aggregation would create noise; human judgment maintains signal
          scope: project
    decisions_made:
        - decision: Split context into checkpoint-specific and project-wide files
          rationale: Keeps LLM context manageable (project + recent entries) while preserving full historical detail
          alternatives_considered:
            - Single aggregated context file
            - Automated context summarization
          constraints_that_influenced: LLM context window limits and need for both detail and manageability
          scope: project
        - decision: Use append-only recommendations queue in project file
          rationale: Avoids automation complexity while providing helpful suggestions that human can review and incorporate
          alternatives_considered:
            - Automated merging of project-scoped items
            - Separate recommendations file
          constraints_that_influenced: Human responsibility for curation quality, need for simple workflow
          scope: project
        - decision: Include commit_hash in context entries for linking
          rationale: Allows correlation between context, changelog, and git history
          scope: checkpoint
        - decision: Pre-populate all project document fields with examples
          rationale: Provides clear structure and guidance for human curators
          scope: checkpoint
    established_patterns:
        - pattern: Multi-document YAML for consumption doc + recommendation queue
          rationale: First document stays clean for LLM consumption, subsequent docs provide curation suggestions
          examples: .checkpoint-project.yml structure with main doc followed by recommendations per checkpoint
          scope: project
        - pattern: Context items marked with scope field to indicate checkpoint vs project applicability
          rationale: Enables automatic extraction of project-level recommendations while keeping checkpoint-specific details separate
          examples: key_insights, decisions_made, failed_approaches, established_patterns all support scope field
          scope: project
    conversation_context:
        - exchange: Discussed whether context belongs in changelog or separate file - decided separate
          outcome: Context has different lifecycle and consumption pattern than changelog; separation maintains clarity
        - exchange: Questioned whether to automate project file updates - decided against
          outcome: Human curation is essential for quality; tool provides recommendations as queue for review
        - exchange: Debated context file format and line length restrictions
          outcome: Context uses .yml extension with relaxed line lengths for detailed explanations
        - exchange: Identified that language detection belongs in meta document as project characteristic
          outcome: Led to understanding that some context is project-level, some is checkpoint-level
