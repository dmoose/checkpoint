# Fix Bug

{{bug_description}}

## Project: {{project_name}}

## Investigation Process

1. **Reproduce the bug**
   - Minimal reproduction case
   - Identify conditions

2. **Understand root cause**
   - Use debugger/logging
   - Trace execution
   - Identify where it breaks

3. **Design fix**
   - Address root cause, not symptoms
   - Consider edge cases
   - Think about similar bugs

4. **Implement fix**
   - Minimal change to fix issue
   - Follow project patterns
   - Add defensive checks

5. **Test**
   - Verify fix works
   - Add regression test
   - Test edge cases

6. **Document**
   - Explain root cause in checkpoint
   - Document prevention strategy

## When Done

I'll run `checkpoint check` and you'll create checkpoint entry explaining:
- What was broken
- Root cause
- How fixed
- How to prevent similar bugs
