# Implement Feature: {{feature_name}}

{{feature_description}}

Priority: {{priority}}

## Project: {{project_name}}

Language: {{primary_language}}

## Process

1. **Understand requirements**
   - Clarify any ambiguities
   - Identify edge cases

2. **Review existing code**
   - Find similar features
   - Check `.checkpoint-project.yml` for patterns

3. **Design approach**
   - Consider alternatives
   - Think about testing
   - Plan error handling

4. **Implement**
   - Follow project patterns
   - Write clear code
   - Add comments for complex logic

5. **Test**
   - Unit tests for logic
   - Integration tests if needed
   - Edge cases and errors

6. **Document**
   - Update relevant docs
   - Add code comments
   - Update API docs if needed

## When Done

I'll run `checkpoint check` and you'll create the checkpoint entry explaining:
- What changed
- Why this approach
- What patterns were followed
- What's next
