# Development Session Start

I'm working on {{project_name}} ({{primary_language}}).

## Current Status

Run `checkpoint start` to see project status and next steps.

## Task

Let's work on: {{task_description}}

## Process

1. Implement the changes
2. Test thoroughly
3. When done, I'll run `checkpoint check`
4. You'll analyze changes and fill `.checkpoint-input`
5. I'll review and run `checkpoint commit`

## Project Patterns

Check `.checkpoint-project.yml` for established patterns and conventions.
